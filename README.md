# Nick's MVC Tech Blog

## Description
The part of this project that i liked the most was that it feels like these challenges are more closer to something that we would find to use in their regular day like a blog. This project was made in order to go through mvc structure and learn it. We had to develop the config, views, controllers. db, models, the utils, js and the seed data to make this. I learned a lot about the mvc structure in making this, that heroku needed the jawdb buildpack added, and how to build out the index using the handlebars more with the partials and the hooks.
